#Grievous 

##A famous quote by Grievous:  

"I hear a lot of talking, General, but in the final accounting, what does all that talk get you? A futile quest for power, a mutilated body? Your place is Dooku's errand boy!"

#Coconut Milk Fudge

![](Coconut_Milk_Fudge.jpg)

##Ingredients

* 1 cup sweetened condensed milk
* 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut milk
* 2 tablespoons salted or unsalted butter (salted will give the candy more contrast)
* 2 teaspoons light corn syrup
* 1/3 cup finely shredded unsweetened coconut 
* 1/3 cup ground pistachios
* 1/3 cup chocolate sprinkles or "vermicelli" 

##Special kitchen tools needed

* medium-sized sauce pan
* medium-sized bowl

##Steps 

1. In a medium-size heavy saucepan, combine condensed milk, coconut milk, butter and corn syrup 
2. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce heat to low and whisk constantly until fudgy 
3. Slide mixture into a bowl. (Don't scrape the pan; leave any residue behind) 
4. Let cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until very firm, at least 4 hours
5. Scoop out teaspoonfuls of the mixture and use your hands to roll into balls, about 3/4-inch in diameter.
6. Place toppings in wide bowls and roll brigadeiros through them, covering the surface completely. 
7. Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 1 month. Serve at room temperature.

###Notes

Best served in winter 

Chocolate "vermicelli": I got a little freaked out when I saw the ingredient list on the chocolate sprinkles I had brought home from the store. Look, I don't need to pretend that chocolate sprinkles are health food, but I like to imagine I'm eating something with at least a minute smidgen of chocolate in it. I ended up spending way too much on a bottle of "chocolate vermicelli" (they look like chocolate sprinkles but are almost 100% pure chocolate, and delightfully, taste that way too) but I'd buy them next time from Amazon or King Arthur Flour's Baker's Catalog for much less.

Pistachios: Since toasted nuts always, always taste better than raw ones, I toasted and ground a batch to coat the candy only to find the brown/green shade. um, a little unpretty. Looks won out and I used ground raw pistachios in the end. I actually ended up preferring the softness of the coating.

Those tiny cups: I know someone is going to ask me where I bought those colorful little candy cups and I'm sorry, as my answer could not be more inconvenient: Vienna. A grocery store. I'm kind of obsessed with going to grocery stores in foreign countries and always walk out with random stuff like this. Anyway, Amazon sells #4 size cups (1-inch base) in brown and white; however, mine are actually #3 size (3/4 to 7/8-inch base) which I found online at a smaller store.

#Euclidean Distance

##Definition

The **Euclidean distance** between points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment ($\overline{pq}$)

In Cartesian coordinates, if **p** = ($p_1, p_2,\dots, p_n$) and **q** = ($q_1, q_2,\dots, q_n$) are two points in Euclidean _n_-space, then the distance (d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the Pythagorean formula:

_d_(p,q) = _d_(q,p) = $\sqrt{(q_1-p_1)^2+(q_2-p_2)^2+\dots+(q_n-p_n)^2}$

= $\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(q_i-p_i)^2}$

The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a Euclidean vector. So, **p** and **q** may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space (initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The **Euclidean norm**, or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector:

||p|| = $\sqrt{p_1^2+p_2+2+\dots+p_n^2}$= $\sqrt{p \cdot p}$

where the last expression involves the dot product.
